# weather
Using React, Redux, Node &amp; the ~~Yahoo Weather~~ Dark Sky API to build a weather app. It's tight. 

### Usage
Prerequisites: Node `&&` NPM (@latest)

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your fork in terminal: `git clone <PATH TO YOUR FORK OF THIS REPO>`
2. Still in terminal: `cd weather && npm install` then run `nodemon`. (this starts the Node server for API requests)
3. In _another_ terminal window: `cd weather/react-ui/ && npm install` then run `npm start` (this starts React and Sass)
